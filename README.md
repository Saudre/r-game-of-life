## Launch

Open the `game-of-life.r` file and run it.

The program will automatically open a new graphic window playing with the game.

If you are using a macOS system, within the function `simulation`, a function called `windows` calls the graphic device. You need to change that function by `quartz` in order to open the graphic device.

## How to use

You can control the number of cells by changing the values of `board_row` and `board_col`

Initially, The game has been set up with a square board with 10 thousand cells.

You can also easily control the cells' color. The const `my_color` within `simulation` function is a vector with two values `c(1, 5)` â€” the first value controls the color for the dead cells and the second one for the live cells.
